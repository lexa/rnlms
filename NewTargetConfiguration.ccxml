    <configuration XML_version="1.2" description="Simulates C67x core, L1D, L1P, L2 Caches, EDMA, QDMA, Timer(2), EMIF interfacing with async &amp; SDRAM memory models, McBSP(2), McASP(2) and interrupt selector. Does not model HPI and I2C. &#10; This is a cycle accurate device configuration and hence suitable for device level application development &amp; benchmarking. &#10; Note on other configurations of this device: &#10; * There is a corresponding faster configuration available which simulates the device in a functional (bit-accurate) manner. This configuration is suitable for application development at the device level but not for device level benchmarking, as it is not cycle accurate.To select the device functional simulator, click on &quot;Advanced&quot; button and then change the &quot;Simulator Type&quot; to &quot;Functional&quot; in the CPU Properties dialogue. &#10; * Also, note that there is a core only (C67x CPU Cycle Accurate) configuration available in the &quot;General Setup&quot; that is faster than the device configurations; suitable for development and benchmarking of core level algorithms." id="C6713 Device Cycle Accurate Simulator, Little Endian">
